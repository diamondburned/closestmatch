# THIS IS A MODIFIED VERSION OF CLOSESTMATCH!  DOCUMENTATION WILL BE INACCURATE UNTIL I UPDATE.  This fork allows an interface to be attached to each searchable item so we can return anything we want.

Fork includes:

- Type-safe extra data next to Matches
- Custom score attached to each Match
- Case-insensitive search
- `MatchAll` returns all matches
- `ClosestValue` returns matches with the value or less

Import: `libdb.so/closestmatch`
